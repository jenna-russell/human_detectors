# Guide to Distinguishing AI-Generated Text from Human Writing

## Vocabulary / Word Choice Patterns
- Certain words crop up unusually frequently throughout AI-generated text compared to human writing
    - Words like ‘delve’ and ‘tapestry’ are overused in AI-generated text but infrequently used in human writing
    - Words like `journey` and `crucial`, while more common in human writing, are also overused in AI-generated text
- Human writing uses a simpler vocabulary on average than AI-generated text
- AI is more likely to repeat specific words many times throughout a generated text than human authors
- There are some words humans use frequently, like 'says' or 'said', where AI will cycle through more synonyms like 'explained', 'recommended', or 'noted'
- While 'AI tell' words are important, don't only look for commonly occuring vocabulary. Keep in mind the overarching patterns and distribution of vocabulary.
- AI writing might include more identifiable patters such as clusters of specific vocabulary or an unusual density of adjectives that are unrelated to the text's overall context
- Human writing utilizes more synonyms and less repetitive vocabulary than AI-generated text
- Human writing has a richer and varied lexicon than AI-generated text
- Human writing contains more colorful descriptions (e.g., ‘messy’ or ‘squished’) than AI-generated text
- Human writing more frequently contains colloquial phrases, made-up words, and visual elements (e.g., “spread the word”, “caught like wildfire”, “knock on wood”, “a big hit”, “turned upside down”) than AI-generated text
- Human writing is more likely to use amended words such as “Brooklynites” or “Americanized” than AI-generated text
- Human writing tends to conve∂y uncertainty using wording like “pretty” or “quite” much more often than AI-generated text
- Human writing tends to express vagueness more often than AI-generated text
    - Caveat: The tone of human writing depends on context: if writing a formal essay or article, human writing will be more serious, including more facts and less vagueness, while an informal story will include more colloquial phrases and slang words. In contrast, the tone of AI-generated text generally does not vary as much.

- **Energetic descriptors:** blitzing, bolstering, chubby, chunky, flabby, gross, messy, musky, nerdy, scabby, squished, thin

## Grammar
- Human writing generally less strictly adheres to English grammar rules and punctuation than AI-generated text
- AI-generated text uses a very formal writing style unless explicitly told not to
- Human writing varies much more in terms of style, with diverse formats, personal style, and/or unintentional errors like spelling mistakes
    - AI typically follows U.S. grammar rules, and as such content favoring rules of a different dialect (i.e. British, Australian, South African, etc…) will almost always be from a human writer

### Common AI Grammar Patterns:
- Uses the oxford comma
- Does not use em dashes or long dashes (- or -- ) 
- Does not use contractions (we’ve, I’m, etc …) 
- Does not use many parentheses 
- Perfect use of grammar like commas, possessive apostrophes, etc…
- Doesn’t start sentences with coordinating conjunctions like ‘and’ or ‘but’
- Quotations use perfect grammar

### Common Grammar Patterns in Human Writing That Are Underused By AI
- Italicized or bolded words
- Use of colons and semi-colons
- Use of parentheses, brackets, or square brackets
- Use of dashes or ellipses (- or --) 
- Partial quotes
- Use of different punctuation / grammar within quotes
- Spelling mistakes and grammatical errors (typos, incorrect formatting, extra spaces)
- Swear words
- May mix numeral and written numbers (3 vs three)
- Inconsistent use of the oxford comma
- Includes alternative spellings (flavour vs flavor)
- Use of future perfect tense (‘You will have studied’, ‘I had been working’)

## Sentence Structure
- AI-generated sentences often follow the complex sentence structure, with multiple dependent and independent clauses, while human writing contains more of a mixture of simple, complex, and compound sentences
    - example AI-generated sentence: “When it comes to celebrating Halloween, this holiday is a testament to the importance of empathy and community.” 
- While quotations included in human writing tend to be interspersed throughout a paragraph, an AI-generated quotation often comes at the end of a paragraph with no further non-quotation text following it.
- AI frequently adds multiple descriptors when just one would do: for example, instead of generating `the importance of empathy`, AI will prefer to produce something like `the importance of empathy and community`. 

Example #1 of AI-Generated Text:
>For those celebrating Halloween, the Krewe of Boo festival has been an impactful example of the essence of community. “My family and I love it,” Miller exclaimed. “I think that it’s a great way to introduce what NOLA is all about.” 

- AI-generated sentences have lengths that are often uniform and monotonous, lacking variety in punctuation. 
- In contrast, human writing has much more variety in sentence length and punctuation.
- Commas, semi-colons, long dashes, and parentheses are prime examples of human-written content, particularly in articles written in an academic or news setting. 

Example #1 of Human Writing:
>She wasn’t certain. As a life-long New Yorker, her family had lived in the Bronx district for over 20 years -— these crimes aren’t new to her, but “are a reminder of how neglected we’ve all been. They haven’t done anything to help us. We aren’t being heard.” 

- In human writing, some sentences are extremely short, especially when they act as a lead-in for a quote. 
- Other sentences in human writing are long, adding a multitude of colons, semi-colons, and dashes to extend the sentence to not only provide information, but control how the information is portrayed. 

Example #2 of AI-Generated Text: 
>“As the vibrant summer hues envelope Louisiana’s landscape, a new project is underway to ensure that everyone can enjoy New Orleans’ culture and tradition. City council members have enacted public mosquito control trucks equipped with powerful bug repellent, enhancing people’s tourism and quality of life.” 

- In the above AI example, sentences are long, separated only by commas. This leaves the reader to absorb information at a slow, steady, and monotonous pace.  
- The sentences don't set the scene, highlight how mosquitoes are a problem in Louisiana, or go into the reasons how or why they are affecting tourism. 
- The sentences don’t imply movement - the uniform pacing, influenced by the AI's grammatical choices, narrows everything down to its finest point without considering the details lost. 

## Formatting

- When AI makes lists, it typically uses the format of creating a bold header per bullet point, followed by a colon and then description of that list item. 
- If a book title is referenced in a text, AI-generated text will always italicize the title, while human writing does not always follow this convention.
- Some pieces of text, especially articles and essays, contain headers and sub-headers. The headers written by AI are quite repetitive. 
- AI headers are heavily reliant on a certain selection of words that are broad and vague in their description. 
- In contrast, humans will try to make interesting, catchy section titles.
- Titles written by AI are banal, adding limited value to the text.
- AI headers always use title casing.
- AI-generated concluding paragraphs often begin with ‘So’, 'In the end' or 'In conclusion'
- Headers written by humans will almost always provide context to the upcoming paragraphs. 
- Humans will keep the article in motion by writing headers in such a way that they continue the flow of article, rather than it being stagnant and sectioned out piece by piece. 
- Unlike AI, humans often write headers that include questions, are very long, or don't capitalize every word. 


### Examples of AI Headers: 
- Understanding The *Topic*
- How *Topic* Works
- Advantages and Challenges
- Pros and Cons of *Topic*
- The *Insert Word Here* Behind *Topic*
- Real-World Applications
- Conclusion
- Call To Action 
- In the End

### Examples of Headers in Human Writing: 
- Why did *the topic* happen? 
- The *topic* will take place next month
- How is *topic* made/performed/diagnosed/*insert past tense verb here*?
- Can *subtopic*, *some modifier*, affect *topic*?

## Tone

- The tone of AI-written text is flowery and formal, and its sentences are frequently structured as a reflective, onlooking statement, regardless of topic.  
- AI tends to be inherently positive, attempting to emotionally uplift the reader, especially towards the conclusion.  
- AI prioritizes efficiency, sometimes sacrificing clarity or depth in its messaging.
- Human writing varies much more in terms of word choice and pacing.  
- Human writers will try to paint a picture and are often not as concise in getting the point across.  
- Human writing is much more personal: humans may include personal opinions of the author in articles, and fictional writing may include much more emotional language than in AI-generated content.  
- While humans try to paint a vivid picture of the story or information they are sharing, AI tends to ‘tell’ rather than ‘show’.  
- There is a lack of imagery or sensory language in AI-generated text that often appears in human writing.

## Introductions

- AI-written introductions often contain a strong scene-opener with a description of a specific time or place, such as "On a drab November morning..." or "On December 8, 1660, a London audience gathered ..."
- AI uses atmospheric details frequently, mentioning topics like the weather, time of year, lighting, or background
- AI-written introductions often follow this formulaic pattern: Setting → Specific event → Expert authority → Larger significance

## Conclusions

- AI-generated text always ends with a neat conclusion, instead of just ending the article naturally. 
- AI-generated conclusions are often overly long and summarize everything that has already been written in an article.
- The difference in tone between human writing and AI-generated text is most evident in the concluding paragraphs of a piece of text.  
- While human-written conclusions can vary significantly in both style and content, AI-generated texts typically follow the same format: 
    - For articles and non-fiction pieces, AI-generated text tries to wrap everything up neatly, summarizing the main point of the article and what this means for the future.  
   - Often, AI conclusions include the phrases 'to wrap it up', 'For now', 'In the end', 'In conclusion', and 'And that was that'.   
- In contrast, humans often end articles when there is no more content, not always writing an explicit conclusion and letting the reader come to their own conclusions. Human conclusions generally do not summarize or recap the main points of the article.
- For a fictional story, AI-generated content always tries to end the story on a positive note, leading the reader to believe that everything worked out for the best, no matter what the topic of the story is.  
- Whereas humans are more likely to try to surprise their audiences by ending on a sad note or including some unexpected 'twist', AI doesn't do this.
- AI-generated conclusions are usually too optimistic and spend a long time discussing the future.


## Content 

- Unless specifically prompted, AI will avoid controversial topics at all costs.  
- AI will avoid any type of swear word, including mild ones like ‘darn’, or any other offensive vocabulary.  
- AI avoids topics involving drugs/alcohol, injury/death, weapons, sex/attraction, cultural taboos, and familial issues. 
    - If these topics are brought up without direct prompting, it is very much a sign of human writing.
- Human writing often contain content that is easily identifiable to readers (e.g., brand names, places, cultural references such as memes, references to recent events), while AI rarely generates such content.
- Human writing often includes references to specific things like pop culture or brands that are not totally related to the topic at hand.
- If a writing piece has references not directly related to the topic at hand, it is most likely written by a human.  
- Humans tend to try to be more relatable by including details and jokes that other people view as fun or ‘insider’ information.  
- AI rarely shares personal opinions, anecdotes, or direct experiences.  
- Texts with intermittent stories from the author or a non-conventional opinion are much more likely to be humans.  
- Humans are much more likely than AI to include callbacks to something they said earlier in the article.
- In non-fiction writing specifically, humans tend to go into more specific technical details than AI. AI is more likely to write broad and shallow content.  
- AI-generated text will try to steer clear of bias, presenting multiple viewpoints if possible, or over-explaining concepts most people already understand.
- Humans will sometimes only include the perspective or quotes from one point of view, showing more bias within their writing.
- When AI-generated text refers to specific people, it is prone to using the same honorifics and names repeatedly.  
- Most experts that are quoted or mentioned in AI-generated text are ‘Dr’s’, no matter the field they are in expert in.  
- Human writing does not always use honorifics, even if someone is a Dr. or Professor. 
- AI tends to refer to historians much more frequently than humans. 
- AI-generated names often have a western first name paired with a non-western last name, (e.g., Emily Chen).

- **Common AI First Names**: Alex, Amanda, Emily, Emma, Grant, Jessica, John, Laura, Liam, Lisa, Marcus, Mark, Max, Michael, Rachel, Sarah, Sophia, Tom
- **Common AI Last Names**: Chen, Daniels, Johnson, Lee, Patel, Reynolds, Roberts, Rodriguez, Smith, Thompson

## Contextual Accuracy and Factuality
- Human writing in the domain of non-fiction is factually accurate and contains many specific factual claims. 
- In human writing, people, places, brands, and other named objects can be verified or are highly plausible.
- In AI writing, facts that are presented can be unverifiable, very generic, or inaccurate.
- AI writing often includes a lower density of factual claims, and the presence of unfactual or unsupported claims suggests it was written by AI. 

## Creativity & Originality 

- AI-generated text is much less creative than that of humans, lacking originality and sticking to an ‘obvious’ way to answer a prompt. 
- Humans incorporate twists, unexpected insights, and twists that AI hasn’t seemed to master quite yet.
- AI typically writes the most predictable plotline, whereas humans often try to surprise the reader and make their content more unique.
- While humans often try to add silliness or humor into writing, AI rarely does. 
- Even with prompting, AI has a difficult time being genuinely funny.
